<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main idea of this project is to provide a robust and fast API for the game "Who Sings". This service is integrated with [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/) lyrics database, allowing the player to have a real experience based on existing songs and artists. 
The game is based on a quiz where the player has to choose who sings a snippet of lyrics provided with 3 options of artists. After completing these quizzes the game ends and the player receives a final score based on the number of correct answers.



### Built With

This service is built based on the following technologies
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
## Documentation

You can find a full complete API documentation [here](https://augustoam.github.io/who-sings-game-api/). 
This documentation is generated by using a library called [dociql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gcappello/dociql) which provides a beautiful static HTML based on a graphql introspection query. The HTML pages and the config file used by dociql can be found inside the docs folder.

You can also find a GraphQL playground in the endpoint http://localhost:4000/.
