<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main idea of this project is to provide a robust and fast API for the game "Who Sings". This service is integrated with [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/) lyrics database, allowing the player to have a real experience based on existing songs and artists. 
The game is based on a quiz where the player has to choose who sings a snippet of lyrics provided with 3 options of artists. After completing these quizzes the game ends and the player receives a final score based on the number of correct answers.



### Built With

This service is built based on the following technologies
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
